## Overview

FRCLinks takes the pain out of navigating the FIRST website. It lets you use short and memorable URLs which
redirect to the appropriate pages on [firstinspires.org](http://firstinspires.org).

For example, to find the page listing Team 254's information and past events and awards, don't visit
the FIRST website and have to click through several pages and menus; instead, just point your browser to
[frclinks.com/t/254](http://frclinks.com/t/254). Similarly, if you want to visit Team 296's website but don't
know the address, just go to [frclinks.com/w/296](http://frclinks.com/w/296).

For the full list of available shortcuts, see the [frclinks.com](http://frclinks.com) homepage.

## Implementation Details

FRCLinks is written in Python and runs on Google App Engine. Please excuse the code mess; the bulk of it was
written over the span of a few hours and I didn't really know Python when I started.
